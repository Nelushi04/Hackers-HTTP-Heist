# Hacker’s HTTP Heist – TryHackMe Room (Designed & Documented)

This repository contains my custom-designed 
It’s an interactive learning experience focused on **two advanced web vulnerabilities**:  
🔀 HTTP Response Splitting  
🕳️ HTTP Request Smuggling

## 🛠What’s Inside?

- 🎯 Full walkthrough covering theory + hands-on simulations
- 🔐 Demonstrated exploitation of real-world vulnerabilities
- 🧪 CTF-style final challenge to apply concepts
- 🧠 Built with inspiration from my own **bug bounty experiences**
- 📄 Report PDF: [TryHackMe_Room_Report.pdf](./TryHackMe_Room_Report.pdf)

## Key Learnings

- Understand how proxies and web servers interpret requests
- Simulate attacks using CRLF injection and request desynchronization
- Analyze the dangers of header manipulation
- Implement mitigation techniques: input validation, proxy hardening, consistent parsing

## Who’s It For?

- Bug bounty hunters  
- Web developers and security learners  
- Anyone curious about HTTP quirks that lead to massive exploits!
